Stephen \"Jimmy\" Donaldson (born May 7, 1998), widely known as MrBeast, is a prominent American YouTuber credited with pioneering videos centered on expensive stunts and challenges. With over 210 million subscribers, he holds the record as the most-subscribed individual on YouTube and the second-most-subscribed channel overall. He ranked on Forbes\\' list as the highest-paid YouTube creator in 2022.\\n\\nDonaldson, born in Wichita, Kansas, grew up mainly in Greenville, North Carolina, with his brother CJ. His parents, who served in the military, divorced in 2007. He attended Greenville Christian Academy and briefly enrolled at East Carolina University before dropping out in 2016 to pursue a full-time career on YouTube.\\n\\nHe began his YouTube journey in 2012 at the age of 13 under the pseudonym \"MrBeast6000.\" Initially, his content ranged from Let\\'s Plays to videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He gained popularity in 2017 with a viral \"counting to 100,000\" video, marking the start of his rising fame.\\n\\nDonaldson\\'s content transitioned into challenges and giveaways, becoming more grand and extravagant as his channel grew. He employed childhood friends to help manage the brand, growing to a team of over 250 individuals by 2023.\\n\\nBeyond his primary channel, Donaldson manages several others, including Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, and Beast Philanthropy. He also founded MrBeast Burger and Feastables, along with philanthropic initiatives like Team Trees and Team Seas.\\n\\nHis videos are categorized into stunts, \"junklord\" content, and giveaways, meticulously designed to go viral by maximizing click-through rate and viewer retention. The funding for these videos primarily comes from sponsorships and Google\\'s AdSense program, with each video reportedly costing around $1 million to produce.\\n\\nDespite his immense success, allegations surfaced about a difficult work environment for his employees. Former employees claimed verbal abuse and an intense work atmosphere behind the scenes.\\n\\nDonaldson also invested in various ventures, including Backbone, Current, and Juice Funds, showcasing a diversified business portfolio.\\n\\nIn his personal life, Donaldson dated Maddy Spidell from 2019 to 2022 and has been in a relationship with Thea Booysen since 2022. He distanced himself from his evangelical Christian background, identifying as agnostic and expressing regret for past anti-LGBT rhetoric.\\n\\nHis immense popularity and philanthropic efforts have earned him recognition, awards, and even a spot on Time\\'s list of the world\\'s most influential people in 2023. Despite controversies and criticisms, he remains one of the most prominent figures on YouTube, constantly pushing boundaries in content creation and philanthropy.', metadata={'source': 'MrBeast.txt'})]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Text splitting + Embedding\n","text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000,chunk_overlap=0)\n","docs = text_splitter.split_documents(document)\n","embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()\n","db = FAISS.from_documents(docs,embeddings)\n","\n","query = \"Who is Mr Beast\"\n","\n","doc = db.similarity_search(query)\n","\n","llm = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id=\"google/flan-t5-xxl\", model_kwargs={\"temperature\":1e-3, \"max_length\":32})\n","\n","chain = load_qa_chain(llm,chain_type=\"stuff\")"],"metadata":{"id":"vaCqnM_Lnfdh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701283538281,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":2401,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Osman","userId":"08171945771844492397"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"d0135c81-b614-4eb5-9839-3c6e6da83af8"},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/huggingface_hub/utils/_deprecation.py:127: FutureWarning: '__init__' (from 'huggingface_hub.inference_api') is deprecated and will be removed from version '1.0'. `InferenceApi` client is deprecated in favor of the more feature-complete `InferenceClient`.
